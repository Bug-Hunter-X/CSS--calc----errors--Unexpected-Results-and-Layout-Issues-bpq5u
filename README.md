# CSS `calc()` Errors: Unexpected Results and Layout Issues

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  The issue lies in the improper use of the `calc()` function, particularly concerning operator precedence and the context in which it's used.  The `bug.css` file showcases the incorrect implementation, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.

The problem stems from not correctly handling the order of operations within the `calc()` expression and also ensures that the containing element has correctly defined dimensions before using `calc()` to determine relative sizes.  The solution focuses on improving the clarity and correctness of the calculation, ensuring the expected layout is achieved.
